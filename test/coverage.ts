/**
 * shared coverage / glob plumbing for the matrix builder.
 *
 * every test (`crossagent/`, `agnostic/`) and every provider entry
 * (`providers.ts`) declares a `coverage` array of repo-relative globs. on a PR
 * push, the `changes` job feeds the changed-file list into `matrix.ts`, which
 * intersects each entry's globs against the diff and emits only the entries
 * that need to run.
 *
 * `ALWAYS_RUN_ALL` is the escape hatch: any change to a file matched here
 * forces the full matrix (every test, every flagship, every alias). it
 * captures cross-cutting infrastructure where fan-out is unpredictable —
 * agent loader, MCP server boot, test runner itself. if a per-test glob
 * goes stale, this list and the on-`main`-full-matrix policy are the safety
 * nets — there's no completeness lint.
 *
 * `coverage` is optional on tests/providers; missing = always run (treat as
 * "any code change touches me"). default to defensive — opt into precision
 * by adding globs.
