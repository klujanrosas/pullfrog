// GitHub Actions `post:` entry point. Runs after the main step regardless of
// exit status (cancellation, timeout, unhandled error) — that's the contract
// we need for credential persistence: if OpenCode refreshed the Codex
// auth.json during the run, the refreshed token must land back in Pullfrog
// even when the main step died unexpectedly.
//
// THIS IS WHY `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` HAS TO LIVE IN PULLFROG'S OWN SECRET STORE,
// NOT IN GITHUB ACTIONS SECRETS. The refresh chain rotates on every use; this
// hook PUTs the rotated chain back to Pullfrog Postgres so the next run starts
// from a fresh token. GH Actions secrets are read-only at runtime — there is
// no API to write them back from inside a job — so a token stashed there
// silently goes stale on the first refresh and the next run fails. See
// wiki/codex-auth.md.
//
// Today's only job: detect a Codex auth refresh by diffing the on-disk
// auth.json against the original refresh token (saved to GH Actions state
// by action/agents/opencode.ts — see also the legacy v1 file kept as
// reference at action/agents/opencode.ts), convert OpenCode's auth shape
// back to Codex CLI shape, and PUT it to /api/runtime/secret.
//
// Silent no-op when the main step didn't materialize Codex auth (no state
// saved). Best-effort: failures are logged but never throw — the workflow
// is already done, and a missed refresh write-back means the user re-runs
// `pullfrog auth codex` next time the chain breaks.
//
// Imports here MUST stay stdlib-only — GHA runs this file directly from the
// checked-out action repo, which has no node_modules for sha-pinned consumers.
