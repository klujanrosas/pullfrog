 * design rule: ToolState is LITERAL. each field records a thing that
 * happened — `review` is set when `create_pull_request_review` succeeded,
 * `finalSummaryWritten` flips when `report_progress` wrote a non-plan body,
 * `selectedMode` is set when `select_mode` was called. fields should never
 * encode the absence of an event ("unsubmittedReview", "missingArtifact"),
 * speculative state, or values derived from other fields.
 *
 * any predicate the rest of the code needs ("the agent picked review mode but
 * never produced a review or progress write") is computed inline at the call
 * site, not stored. derived state in this struct invariably drifts from the
 * literal fields under refactors and is the wrong layer for the check.
 *
 * write narrowly: prefer adding state inside the tool that mutates it (e.g.
 * `create_pull_request_review` populates `toolState.review`) and reading
 * narrowly elsewhere. don't introduce flags from main.ts that mirror what an
 * MCP tool already records.
